# Datasets for Time Series Forecasting
> Time series are ubiquitous in todayâ€™s data-driven world. Given historical data, time series forecasting (TSF) is a long-standing task and aims to predict future multi-step data. It has a wide range of applications, including but not limited to traffic flow estimation, energy management, economics investment, weather forecasting, and disease predictions. 

This repository collects public benchmark datasets for Time Series Forecasting (TSF), in which all the datasets are well pre-processed and can be used directly. According to whether to consider the correlations between sensors (nodes), we roughly divide them into two categories as follows:

## Without Considering Correlation Between Sensors
### Brief Introduction of Datasets
- [ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature)](https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/ETDataset):
This dataset consists of two `hourly-level` datasets (ETTh) and two `15-minute-level` datasets (ETTm). Each of them contains one oil and six load features of electricity transformers from July 2016 to July 2018.
- [Traffic](http://pems.dot.ca.gov):
This dataset from the California Department of Transportation describes the road occupancy rates between 0 and 1. It contains the `hourly` data recorded by the sensors of San Francisco Bay area freeways from 2015.01 to 2016.12. 
- [Electricity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014):
This dataset collects the `hourly` electricity consumption in KWh of 321 clients from 2012 to 2014. Note that, the raw dataset records every `15 minutes` from 2011 to 2014 while some dimensions of data are equal to 0. Thus, the records in 2011 are removed. 
- [Exchange-Rate](https://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data):
This dataset collects the `daily` exchange rates of 8 countries, including Australia, British, Canada, Switzerland, China, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore, from 1990.01 to 2016.12.
- [Weather](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/):
This dataset includes 21 indicators of weather, such as air temperature, and humidity. Its data is recorded every `10 min` for 2020 in Germany.
- [ILI (Influenza-like Illness)](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html):
This dataset describes the ratio of <u>patients seen with influenza-like illness</u> and <u>the total number of the patients</u>. It includes the `weekly` data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States from 2002 to 2021.

## Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of models, there are three commonly used metrics, including **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **MAPE**.
Suppose $\textbf{X}=\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$ represents the ground truth, $\hat{\textbf{X}}=\{\hat{x}_1, ..., \hat{x}_n\}$ represents the predicted
values, and $\Omega$ denotes the indices of observed samples, the metrics are defined as follows.
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE):

$\text{MAE}(\textbf{X}, \hat{\textbf{X}})  = \frac{1}{| \Omega |}  \sum_{i \in \Omega} |x_i - \hat{x}_i|$
* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):

$\text{RMSE}(\textbf{X}, \hat{\textbf{X}}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{| \Omega |} \sum_{i \in \Omega} (x_i - \hat{x}_i)^2}$
* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):

$\text{MAPE}(\textbf{X}, \hat{\textbf{X}})  = \frac{1}{| \Omega |}  \sum_{i \in \Omega} \left | \frac{x_i - \hat{x}_i}{x_i} \right|$
